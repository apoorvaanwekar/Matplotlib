Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis

Trend 1: Though Uber is pulling out all the stops, enticing local drivers, offering discounts, and placing strategic
ads to their move into small-town . Looking at these charts I can conclude, “Uber's doesn’t seem to be working in rural 
area at least not as well as it does in urban areas.

Trend 2: Uber has revolutionized the way people get around in big cities but it’s more of a complimentary service
in smaller towns and rural areas. Since there aren’t as many options to get around in smaller cities, 
I’ve observed looking at these charts that Uber passengers just aren’t as reliant on Uber as they are in bigger cities.

Trend 3: When it comes to Uber drivers what I have observed is, the less urban an area is, the less demand for Uber.
